/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Namo Vṛkṣebhyaḥ Donation Portal.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the /users/{userId} collection.
 * Only the authenticated user with a matching userId can read or write their own document.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * User data is stored under /users/{userId}.  Each document contains basic user information (id, email, firstName, lastName).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * - The rules prioritize security by default, denying access unless explicitly granted.
 * - Schema enforcement is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid data model iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The rules depend on the document ID matching the authenticated user's ID.
 *  This is validated on create and enforced as immutable on update.

     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.  Validates that the document ID matches the authenticated user's ID.
